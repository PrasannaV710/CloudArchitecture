# CloudArchitecture
This repository contains the project report for my Cloud Computing Technology course. It is a detailed report going over our problem statement, business and technical requirements, exhaustive comparisons of different cloud providers, initial and final architecture diagrams, our reasonings for the choices and tradeoffs made, and some experiments we conducted to test the validity of our architecture.
